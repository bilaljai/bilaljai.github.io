  <h2>My Contributions:</h2>
  
  <h3>I primarily worked on the backbone of game with features such as camera movement, player logic, and the health system. Additionally, I</h3> 
  <h3>implemented the animations and interactions with the sandbox. I utilized Photoshop to customize sprites for the enemies and collectables.</h3>
  <h3>I also implemented the AI for some of the enemies.</h3>
  
  <h2>Technology Used:</h2>
  
  <h3>Unity Game Engine to build level, Photoshop for sprites, Jira for project management</h3>
